# Departmental Dynamics

Conducting these interviews was relatively easy and the answers I received were very consistent across the topic areas described in this report. Where deviations of opinions did occur were along the lines of junior and senior faculty although *all* of the senior faculty I interviewed were quite aware of the difficulties facing junior faculty and appeared to be sympathetic. Everyone was collegial and very forthcoming with viewpoints and ideas that will be helpful to the School as a whole. The complaints I heard were entirely relevant and completely understandable and it's clear that even though there are some barriers to research people are nonetheless working very hard to get things done. 

The participants in the interviews process were: Jessica Wells, Irene Yang, Jinbing Bai, Erin Ferratti, Betsy Corwin, Nicole Carslon, Despina Tsementzi, Anna Knight, Deborah Bruner, Mary Gullate (to be conducted in mid November). I sent invitations to  Anne Dunlop and Linda McCauley but received no response. I also had a discussion with Karl Moran at Microbiome Insights since they performed work for Irene Yang. I also contacted Ethenia Why at the Biostatistics Core at Hopkins for comments on their role in Microbiome analysis. I've also got an inquiry to Steven Gill at the University of Rochester Microbiome Core. I've had extensive conversations with both Seven Bridges Genomics and DNANexus as it relates to data and project management as well as computation.
